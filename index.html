                <h1>Do you know fashion supply chain is the 3rd largest pollution industry?</h1>
                <p>Fashion and its supply chain is the third largest polluting industry, after food and construction. It emitted 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, releasing 1.2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, more than the shipping and the aviation industry combined. If it continues at the same pace, the industryâ€™s greenhouse gas emissions are predicted to increase by more than 50% by the year 2030. (earth.org)</p>

                <p>Shared Closet is my personal website for free sharing of clothes that I don't wear/or rarely wear (maybe they're not the right size for me, they're out of fashion for me,). Whenever I buy a piece of clothing, especially fast fashion, I have never considered how many times I will wear it, once, or five times? It relfected an unconscious and incredible textile waste! This is the intention of the SharedCloset, to raise everyone's awareness on textile pollution, especially fast fashion. </p>
